# English Premier League Quiz

Test your Premier League Knowledge with this quiz!

Premier League is the most competitive and most-watched league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.

During the lockdown quizes became popular where the friends and family started playing quiz through video conferencing like skype and many companies started playing quiz as part of the team building exercise. This gave me an idea to develop an interactive quiz application for the Premier league where users can play on their own to improve their premier league knowledge.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

* As the website pages have the background image, I wanted to keep the coulour scheme balanced on the website so as to not overhelm users. In order to avoid text overlayiong on the background I have created shadow boxes that holds the important aspects of the website like questions, score area and instructions box. Blue, white and black colours are generally used in the English Premier League logo, so I have designed my initial colour pallete keeping this in mind.

* For the correct and incorrect choices I went to for the tradiotional green color for the correct choices and red color for the incorrect choice.

### Typography
When choosing the fonts for my website my aim was to keep it simple. On the website there are two fonts getting used that I have imported from Google fonts.

* For all the H1 headings I have used Oswald. As its an eye-catching and ideal for the headers becuase of its boldness.
* For all the main body I have chosen Lato font because of teh balance it strikes between gentle curves and sturdy design, this font gives off a powerful yet welcomng vibe.  

## Features 

The website have been designed to be used across all divce sizes and have been divided into three main sections.

### Home Page
* This page provides user with a brief introduction about the quiz a background image of the English Premier Logo with two call to action buttons (Instructions and Home).
* The buttons also have a hover effect in order to provide feedback to the user for a better user experience.

## Credits

To complete this project I used Code Institute student template: [gitpod full template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)

### Learning Resources

As javascript was a brand new coding language for me initially I struggle to put the initial project structure in place and have to get ideas and learn new feature in javascript that I can adapt in my project.

    * [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com) - I used W3Schools to learn arrow functions how to manipulate DOM and forEach method from this reource.

    * [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I was strugling how to show user end score on the end page until I found a feature called 'localStorage' on this website.

### Code

As part of the learning process I relied on different online tutorials for CSS and Javascript. Some of one I followed for the completion of this are as follows
